# Benchmarking

This document describes how to run some basic performance tests for the proxy.

## Preparation

Download Apache Kafka:

```
$ wget https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.1.0/kafka_2.13-3.4.0.tgz
$ tar xvf kafka_2.13-3.4.0.tgz
```

Start up ZooKeeper and Kafka:

```
$ cd kafka_2.13-3.4.0
$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

## Execution

Build and launch the proxy:

```
$ mvn clean verify -Pdist -Dquick
$ java -jar kroxylicious/target/kroxylicious-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --config kroxylicious/example-proxy-config.yml
```

Run Kafka's _kafka-producer-perf-test.sh_ script:

```
$ bin/kafka-producer-perf-test.sh \
--topic perf-test \
--throughput -1 \
--num-records 10000000 \
--record-size 1024 \
--producer-props acks=all bootstrap.servers=localhost:9192
```

Run once to allow for JVM warm-up, then run another time for getting meaningful values.
This produces large volumes of Kafka logs in _/tmp/kafka-logs_ which should removed after stopping Kafka.

## Results

Results from a benchmark run on Lenovo T14s.

### Direct Kafka

These values are for connecting to Kafka directly.

### Proxy - pass-through

These values show the minimal overhead of the proxy; it doesn't apply any modifications
other than adjusting the advertised host and negotiating API versions.

### Proxy - Lower-case transform

These values show the overhead of an actual message transformation; each produce request
(we assume it's UTF-8 text) is lower-cased:

```
...
new ProduceRecordTransformationFilter(
    buffer -> ByteBuffer.wrap(new String(StandardCharsets.UTF_8.decode(buffer).array()).toLowerCase().getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
)
...
```
